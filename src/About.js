            <p>Hi! 
<div className="create-space" />
As a front end developer, I will commit to creating work that is focused on usersâ€™ needs. <br />
<div className="create-space" />
I have created this portfolio to hold true to my goal by focusing on helping visitors get to know what skills I can bring and who I am in the shortest amount of time!  
<div className="create-space" />
I hope that you found my portfolio easy to navigate through and get the information that you need about me.
<div className="create-space" />
I look forward to working with like minded individuals in creating what people can truly value and find useful.
<div className="create-space" />
Thank you!
